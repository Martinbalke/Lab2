# Lab2
This is my Lab2

This about me asks five yes/no questions to the user. Then updates the user score based off of their answers. The program then asks the user to guess my favorite number and updates the user score if they are correct. Then the program asks the user to guess a country I've lived in. Based off their guess, updates user score which will then be displayed on page.

Driven by Ryan Sanders :)
