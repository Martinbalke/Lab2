                <p> You did a great job going through my guessing game to learn a little bit more about me. So now I will give you a little bit more detail about the questions I asked.</p>
                
                <p>My current job is in food. I'm a professional chef and have worked at some of the best restaurants in the world but now I'm ready for something new and exciting so I've started my career as a Software Developer</p>

                <p>Pizza is definitely one of my favorite foods. But if I'm cooking for myself my favorite thing the make is Macaroni and Cheese</p>

                <p>Disco is my favorite kind of music but I have a really varried taste in music ranging from Soul, R&B, to Rap, and Country!</p>

                <p>I love coding. I think that it's a great tool for making change in the world and I'm very excited to dive into all the complexities.</p>
